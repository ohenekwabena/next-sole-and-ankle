## Sole & Ankle

In my CSS course, we create a sneaker store called [Sole&Ankle](https://github.com/css-for-js/sole-and-ankle). This project is a recreation of that UI, using Next, and exploring different approaches for handling data fetching.

This is part of my React course [The Joy of React](https://joyofreact.com/).
